## 🙋‍♂️  About Me
- Currently a full time CS student at Purdue University in the class of 2025.
- When I'm not climbing, I'm often writing code, usually engulfed in a personal project that distracts me from my schoolwork.
- Outside of CS, I enjoy rock climbing, cooking, and mechatronics projects, usually involving MCU's. Also, did I mention climbing?
- I'm especially interested in web development, and have made it a personal goal of mine to learn full stack web dev when not busy with schoolwork.

## 🔥 My Latest Project
**Check out [**Community Crag!**](https://communitycrag.com), the social media of climbing gyms!**
- This site is a personal project of mine that allows
climbers to share their add-ons online with other members of their gym, and suggest grades on one another's posts.
- Built with Firebase and Google Cloud Storage, bundled with webpack.
- Images are resized with [ImageKit](https://imagekit.io), which speeds up the site and saves a lot of bandwith!
