## 🙋‍♂️  About Me
- Currently a full time CS student at Purdue University, graduating winter 24'
- When I'm not outdoors, I'm often writing code, working on whichever project currently has my attention
- Outside of CS, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, camping, kayaking, cooking, and skateboarding!
## 🔎 I'm especially interested in:
  - Systems and embedded programming. Low level software is lots of fun, and making physical devices using ESP32's and the sort is my cup of tea.
  - Interested in OS/RTOS, efficient memory management, assembly optimization, and computer architecture.
  - Algorithms and Mathematics, because working through problems is fun!
  - Web development! Currently working on the redesign of the well-known [boilerexams](https://boilerexams.com) website at Purdue.
