## 🙋‍♂️  About Me
- Currently a full time CS student at Purdue University, graduating winter 24'
- I truly love computer science! It's definitely my biggest passion. Whenever I'm not working on Comptuer Science homework/projects, I am usually learning about CS anyways.
- When I'm not climbing, I'm often writing code, usually engulfed in a personal project that distracts me from my schoolwork.
- Outside of CS, I enjoy rock climbing, cooking, and mechatronics projects, usually involving MCU's. Also, did I mention climbing?
### I'm especially interested in:
  - Web development, especially in regard to making web apps more interactive and interesting (why are so many websites cookie cutter layouts? I love visually interesting pages...)
  - Algorithms and Mathematics. Working through problems is *really* satisfying, and I love finding clever solutions to tough problems.
  - Systems/embedded programming. I think lower-level software is incredibly fascinating, and I love OS's, memory management, hardware interaction and computer architecture.

## 🛠️ Skills
- JS, HTML/CSS, Node.js, Java, C, Python, Solidity
- Firebase/Firestore, Google Cloud APIs, Webpack, Tailwind CSS
- Git, GitHub, VS Code
- OnShape, Fusion 360
- Working at late hours (especially after getting way too into a project and losing track of time 😅)

## 🔥 My Latest Project
**Check out [**Community Crag!**](https://communitycrag.com), the social media of climbing gyms!**
- This site is a personal project of mine that allows
climbers to share their add-ons online with other members of their gym, and suggest grades on one another's posts.
- Built with Firebase and Google Cloud Storage, bundled with webpack.
- Images are resized with [ImageKit](https://imagekit.io), which speeds up the site and saves a lot of bandwith!
