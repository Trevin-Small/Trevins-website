## 🙋‍♂️  About Me
- Currently a full time CS student at Purdue University in the class of 2025.
- When I'm not climbing, I'm often writing code, usually engulfed in a personal project that distracts me from my schoolwork.
- Outside of CS, I enjoy rock climbing, cooking, and mechatronics projects, usually involving MCU's. Also, did I mention climbing?

## 🛠️ Skills
- Python, JavaScript, Java, C, Solidity, HTML/CSS (Do these two even count?)
- Firebase/Firestore, Google Cloud APIs
- Git, GitHub, VS Code
- Can make a mean bowl of Alfredo
- Working at ridiculuosly late hours

## 🔥 My Latest Project
**Check out [**Community Crag!**](https://communitycrag.com), the social media of climbing gyms!**
- This site is a personal project of mine that allows
climbers to share their add-ons online with other members of their gym, and suggest grades on one another's posts.
- Built with Firebase and Google Cloud Storage, bundled with webpack. The site
is almost ready for launch!
